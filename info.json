  "description": "This mod adds a combinator with an 'output window' - if number of input signal is below max of output signals, then it just shows the same signals, otherwise it rotates an output, showing only part of input signals at one moment. Can be used to avoid filter limit in filter inserters. For filtration purposes combinator can output signals with value '1' instead of actual input signal values (can be configured in settings, by default combinator preserves input values)."
